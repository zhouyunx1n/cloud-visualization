# 🌥 Hong Kong Cloud Cover Visualization  
### *Data-driven generative animation with Python + Pygame*


This project converts real meteorological data into a creative animated visualization.
I collected the cloud cover (%) data of Hong Kong from January 1 to August 31, 2025, cleaned the dataset, and used Python + Pygame to generate a constantly changing visual animation to reflect the cloud cover.

## Note
I tried several visualization approaches — some worked well, and some did not.
